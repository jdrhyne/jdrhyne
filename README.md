I left a law career to build software. Best decision I ever made. Now I run [Nutrient](https://nutrient.io) — the company I co-founded as PSPDFKit back in 2011. We help developers build better document experiences, and our tech powers apps used by nearly a billion people.

These days I'm deep in the AI trenches, exploring how agents change everything about how we work. I have an AI assistant named Brosef who handles my email while I'm at my kid's birthday parties. The future is weird and I'm here for it.

## Current Projects

- 🐙 [claude-code-github](https://github.com/jdrhyne/claude-code-github) — Let Claude handle your Git workflow with natural language

### Philosophy

> "Ship beats perfect" — I went from writing legal briefs to shipping code. Turns out both are just about clear communication and solving problems.

### Random Facts

- 🎓 NC State undergrad → Campbell Law School → said "nah" to practicing law
- 🤝 Co-founded PSPDFKit with [@steipete](https://github.com/steipete) — still friends, still building
- ☕ Powered by North Carolina coffee and the belief that documents don't have to suck
- 🤖 Currently letting AI agents do my email while I live my life
